				<h1>AMRMI Website Redesign</h1>
				<p>The AMResorts Meetings & Incentives website redesign was one of the larger project that I took on as Production Designer in my time at AMResorts. I was only given a few constraints to work within but most of the design decisions were left to me.</p>
				<p>The site had to feel recognizable to older users, keeping the existing architecture intact. I was able to accomplish alot, to start I updated the UI from very image heavy to clean managable code. Parallel to that I aligned the look and feel with the new creative direction of the rest of the segments creative.</p>
				<p>I had the benefit of being the primary editor of the site on a daily basis and I was able to use that experience to inform my decsions. <a href="http://www.amresorts.com/meetings/" target="_blank">Link&nbsp;â€º</a></p>

			<h2>Home Page</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>I kept the navigation familar and placed the RFP submission in a very prominent location</li>
				<li>I used the jQuery slideshow <a href="http://austenpayan.github.io/skippr/">Skippr</a> as a carousel for the six brands and pulled in some more information to fill out the rest of the home page body. This included creating a Keep In Touch for which would allow us to gather leads into a database and load them into our CRM system</li>
				<li>I created a more robust and comprehensive footer, pooling the most important links and information, to be displayed on every page</li>

			<h2>Brand Level Pages</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>I simplified the navigation to only breakdown at a country level and adding headings to indicate regions</li>
				<li>I also tucked the resort information away into a hover animation to reduce the overwhelming amount of text on the page previously</li>

			<h2>Promotions Page</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Here I pulled all of the promotions out carousel which was just not getting the job done</li>
				<li>With so many promotions we needed categories to break them up, and I was able to incorporate just enough information within each tile to inform but not overwhelm a potential client</li>
